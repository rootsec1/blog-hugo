Hey, I am **Abhishek**

I am a software engineer by trade. I love to experiment and play around with tech. I've dabbled in numerous backend servers, mobile & web apps, infrastructure tools, bug bounty programs, security exploits, ML models, and more. I am passionate about self-driving car tech, robotics and building AGI.

Currently, I am building the tech for my startup [ticketdude](https://ticketdude.app/). Before starting up, I also worked as an SDE-2 at [blinkit](https://blinkit.com/) (built supply chain tech to enable 10-minute delivery in India) which later got acquired by [zomato](https://www.zomato.com/) (India's DoorDash). During my time there, I worked with multiple teams including Inventory, StoreOps, and Infrastructure. I eventually led the tech team for all things finance while I was there. More on that [here](https://blinkit.com/blog/first-12-months-blinkit-abhishek-m).

I am a huge fan of [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk), [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama) and [@realgeorgehotz](https://twitter.com/realgeorgehotz). The [geohot archive](https://www.youtube.com/@geohotarchive) is a treasure trove. During undergrad I won numerous national and international hackathons multiple times such as the [Singapore India Hackathon](https://singaporeindiahackathon.com/) and [Smart India Hackathon](https://www.sih.gov.in/) with over **100K+** participants. I was also a [Google Developer Club Lead](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc) as a part of which I led the Bangalore community and held several Android app development workshops across the country. I occasionally perform pen tests and vulnerability assessments on backend servers and mobile apps (frida ftw).

I love anime, dark humor, elon's memes and [r/ExperiencedDevs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/). I am one of the proud owners of an Xbox series X. My favorite games are Cyberpunk 2077 (doesn't deserve all that hate) and RDR2.

We're another day closer to building God, have a great day.
